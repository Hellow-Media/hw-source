Dear fellow worldenators, the Mod Support, UI Overhaul & Inventory Update is here!

Hello there! We just released many significant additions to Hellow World; Block Mod Support, a complete UI Overhaul,  a completely rebuilt Inventory, a brand new Chisel menu, a ton of new interesting Settings, the ability to change Keybinds & more!


The new settings menu adds loads of new options, we decided to add the Brightness, Contrast & Saturation sliders because people might be able to make short films in the future when it actually has content, along with Resolution so people can make the game perform better if needed, or make it look better. 


“MY EYES!” Is what I say when I play Hellow World, the UI is just too dang bright! To counter this, we’ve added a Dark Mode to all UI in the game to give users an extra level of customisation. 


For crying out loud stop asking for an inventory, I mean how hard can it be to just pick block knock knock 🧨 NEW BLOCKS 💥 AHHHHHH, okay fine we added the Inventory, now tons of new blocks are accessible like… pin oak planks? Yeah I don’t really know, but it's here so stop asking! It also has a chisel menu so you can choose similar blocks. 


We’ve added a Keybinds menu so you can not only see but change all of the games keybinds, honestly this is a feature we’ve honestly wanted for a while too. 


And last but certainly not least, the most awaited thing that has been promised year after year in every Hellow Media game, we now have Block Mod Support, you as a real life human being now have the ability to create custom blocks in Hellow World, to go beside this we also have a Mod Wiki available here, we can’t wait to see what you all make! 

We look forward to what the development of Hellow World brings to us in the future, but for now, enjoy the update ❤️ ️.
