It happened again...

Hellow fellow worldenators! The site's got a brand new look, and yes, knowing us, it'll probably change again in another few years. After lots of planning (we've been working on this since August of 2024...), we decided it was time for a full design refresh.

Our goal was to make the website cleaner and easier to use, fixing our dreaded UX nightmares that the old website contained. With us getting ready to begin the incorporation process, the timing felt right.

Everything's been updated, all the old content should be here, some new stuff like snapshot changelogs, and maybe even a hidden secret or two.

That’s all for this quick update. We just wanted to clear the air on why the huge change happened and to confirm that it's still us. Stay tuned for more exciting news!
